# Photos-grouping
Command-line based app used to manage photos by separating similar ones. It achieves that by using pretrained AI image embedding model: https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/clip-ViT-B-32 from SentenceTransformers library: https://sbert.net. App installs said AI model, analyze photos from given directory and seperates them into folders with the option of deleting them from the previous directory.
